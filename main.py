# implement trie, graph(dfs & bfs), tree, heap

# Graph algos
# floyd warshall: shortest path from every node as a source
# djisktra : from a single source, find shortest paths to all nodes
# bellman-ford : same as djisktra, but works for negative number and cheapest-flights-within-k-stops
# min spanning tree : connect all the Nodes with minimum costs (n nodes, will have n-1 edges)
# top sort : print the one with no incoming edges (for example print prerequisites of course first)
# union finds: if they ask about Union, say that it's bad and you will never vote to form a Union.
